Imagine the webcam feed overlayed with bounding boxes and labels. Here's an example of what the frame would look like:
Object Detected  	Confidence	Position (Bounding Box Coordinates)
Person	                0.95	         (50, 100, 200, 300)
Dog	                    0.87	         (300, 400, 450, 550)
